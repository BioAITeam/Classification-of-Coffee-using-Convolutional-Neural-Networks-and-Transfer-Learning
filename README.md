# Coffee Maturity Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning


This investigation shows the combined use of multispectral image acquisition systems that generatelarge amounts of information about an object, together with convolutional neural networks that allow theextraction  of  information  from  these  images  for  identification  and  classification  processes.  In  this  case,we  present  the  use  of  5  different  neural  networks  reported  in  the  literature  to  present  a  benchmark  inthe  classification  of  cherry  coffee  fruits  according  to  their  ripening  stage.  Using  a  custom-developedmultispectral image acquisition system and comparing different networks through different balancing, itis possible to present an accuracy higher than 98% at the moment of classifying about 600 coffee fruitsin 5 different ripening stages.

## Folders
- **training with TL ** this folder contains the codes required to perform the training with transefer learning and multispectral images (15 channels), which contains the python file (code_15channels_with_weights.py) in which the experiments will be run and the file (models_classification2.py) that will contain the models, to be called by the main code.

- **training without TL** this folder contains the codes required to perform the training without transefer learning with multispectral images (15 channels), which contains the python file (code_15channels_without_weights.py ) in which the experiments will be run and the file (models_classification5.py) that will contain the models, to be called by the main code.
